# electron-webpack-quick-start-roy
> A fork of [`jsForth`](https://github.com/brendanator/jsForth) ported to [`Electron`](https://electronjs.org/) and  [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Quick Start
The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roycrippen/electron-forth.git
cd electron-forth
rm -rf .git

# install dependencies
yarn
```

## Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev

# compile source code and create webpack output
yarn compile

# `yarn compile` & create AppImage build with electron-builder
yarn dist
```

## Documentation
Coming soon?
